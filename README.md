# Application

A simple Angular + Ionic application for storing information on rooms like the items in them and tasks that must be completed in them.  
It allows the user to customise the list allowing them to add new rooms, delete rooms and edit the room's names.  
The idea was to showcase some basic Angular functionality like reactive forms, standalone components and CRUD interactivity.
